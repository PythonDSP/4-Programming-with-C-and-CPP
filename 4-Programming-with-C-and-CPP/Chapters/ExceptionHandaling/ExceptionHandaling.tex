%\chapterquote{When a man is, through his desires, confronted with great suffering , he understands their true nature; so when such suffering comes, it should be welcome. Suffering may come in order to eliminate further suffering. Suffering has to come, when it is of use in purging the soul from it's desires. }{Meher Baba}
